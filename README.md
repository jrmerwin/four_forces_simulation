We present a causal integer lattice simulation demonstrating that four qualitatively distinct force behaviors emerge from a single computational engine governed by a 137-bit registry partitioned as **16 (gravitational) + 40 (electromagnetic) + 81 (color)** bits. The simulation employs strictly discrete arithmetic, causal (sequential) propagation, and a universal overflow-fission mechanism governed by a single thermodynamic principle: the minimization of relational potential $E = q\Phi$.

Statistical validation across 20 independent random seeds ($N = 20$, $T = 3{,}000$ ticks) confirms:

1. Gravitational attraction via unsigned depletion gradients ($p < 10^{-4}$)
2. Electromagnetic charge differentiation via signed field annihilation  
   (opposite: $1{,}041 \pm 49$ events; like: exactly 0; $p < 10^{-19}$)
3. Strong force color confinement via high-capacity color annihilation  
   ($1{,}824 \pm 73$ events vs. 0; $p < 10^{-19}$)
4. Weak decay via adjacency-triggered flavor change at rate $n_{\textrm{adj}}/137$ ($p < 10^{-4}$)

### Mechanistic analysis — gravity

Gravitational attraction operates through *differential residence time*, **not** directed fission: masses fission 3–4× more frequently in the away-hemisphere than the toward-hemisphere ($p < 10^{-6}$), while individual fission step directions are perfectly isotropic (toward/away ratio $= 1.00 \pm 0.02$, $p > 0.4$).

This constitutes a discrete-lattice analog of the self-energy problem in continuous field theory — the mass's own radiation dominates the local potential evaluation, preventing direct gradient sensing. Macroscopic displacement emerges nevertheless because spatially non-uniform fission rates create asymmetric residence times, equivalent to Brownian motion in a potential well.

### Registry mutagenesis results

Systematic variation of the 16:40:81 partition across 15 mutant configurations confirms that:

- **(a)** Sector capacity controls force strength  
  (color confinement collapses when color capacity drops from 81 to 16)
- **(b)** Weak decay rate scales linearly with $1/\textrm{TOTAL\_CAP}$  
  ($R^2 = 0.84$, $p = 1.3 \times 10^{-6}$)
- **(c)** Gravity is robust to timing synchronization, proving the trapping mechanism is **topological** rather than temporal

These results constitute the first demonstration that four distinct force behaviors can organically emerge from identical registry overflow rules applied to a partitioned bit architecture.
